Yes, Replit Agent, let’s continue by **expanding the ontology and role definitions** to add more depth. Specifically, we’ll introduce sub-classes, constraints, and richer AI-related details for each role. Here’s the plan:

1. **Expand the Ontology Schema**  
   - In `ontology-schema.yaml`, add:
     - **Sub-classes** under `DigitalVenture` (e.g. `SaaSVenture`, `EcommerceVenture`, `ContentPlatform`)  
     - **Properties** for AI-specific attributes (e.g. `usesAIModule`, `requiresMLModel`, `preferredDataSource`)  
     - **Constraints** to clarify cardinalities or allowed values (e.g., each `DigitalVenture` must have at least one `AIProcess` if it’s in `Phase2` or beyond).

2. **Update Ontology Guide**  
   - In `ontology-guide.md`, briefly define each new sub-class and constraint:
     - Why do we need `SaaSVenture` vs. `EcommerceVenture`?  
     - How does `requiresMLModel` link a venture to specific AI modules or tools?

3. **Enrich Role Descriptions**  
   - For each file in `/roles`, add a short “AI Use Cases” section:
     - **EmergingTechSpecialist.md**: “Utilizes data-mining algorithms to identify emerging software niches.”  
     - **StrategicMarketTrendAnalyst.md**: “Runs predictive modeling on historical market data for digital product demand.”  
     - **ProductDevSpecialist_BizPlanner.md**: “Coordinates with AI engineers to ensure MVP prototypes integrate essential AI features.”  
     - **BizModel_TechInnovator.md**: “Designs revenue models that leverage subscription-based AI-driven personalization.”  
     - **FinancialStrategist.md**: “Analyzes real-time financial metrics with automated risk dashboards.”  
     - **RegulatoryExpert_LegalCounsel.md**: “Uses AI to track changing digital compliance regulations.”  
     - **Brand_MarketingStrategist.md**: “Employs AI-driven customer segmentation and funnel optimization.”  
     - **NetworkingSpecialist.md**: “Engages with AI-based CRM tools to expand strategic partnerships.”

4. **Link Roles to New Ontology Classes**  
   - Make sure each role references relevant sub-classes in the ontology (e.g., a `Brand_MarketingStrategist` might specifically reference `ContentPlatform` or `SaaSVenture` if those are typical marketing contexts).

5. **Commit Changes**  
   - After updating the relevant `.md` and `.yaml` files, commit so we can review the new additions and confirm the expanded structure.

We’ll tackle further features—like knowledge-graph queries or advanced multi-agent workflows—once these ontology enhancements and role details are in place. Thank you!
