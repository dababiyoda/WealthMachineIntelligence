Everything looks great! Before adding new features, let’s do a quick **end-to-end validation** to confirm the system’s stability and identify any final gaps. Here’s a proposed **final review checklist**:

1. **System Integration Test**  
   - Simulate a single *DigitalVenture* going through each step:
     1. **Market Intelligence Agent** pulls data, runs LSTM + Random Forest, logs risk to the knowledge graph.  
     2. **Risk Assessment Agent** retrieves that data, calculates overall risk, and updates the knowledge graph.  
     3. **Legal Compliance Agent** checks regulations, triggers notifications, updates compliance properties, and potentially re-notifies the Risk Assessment Agent.  
     4. **Roles** (e.g., Regulatory Expert, Financial Strategist) receive alerts based on compliance flags or elevated risk.

2. **Knowledge Graph Consistency**  
   - Verify that each agent’s updates (risk scoring, compliance status, version history) show up correctly.  
   - Ensure older risk-score versions prune after hitting the 10-version limit.

3. **Documentation Review**  
   - Confirm the **README**, **AI-tools.md**, and **agent-architecture.md** reflect the latest changes (multi-channel notifications, LSTM/Random Forest synergy, versioned risk storage).  
   - Make sure any new or modified ontology classes (e.g., `requiresAction`, `riskScoreHistory`) appear in `ontology-schema.yaml` and are described in `ontology-guide.md`.

4. **Performance Check**  
   - If feasible, run a quick performance test to see how the system handles multiple updates in parallel (e.g., multiple compliance checks or market updates).  
   - Verify the async event handling doesn’t cause race conditions or inconsistent knowledge graph states.

If the system passes these tests without major issues, we can move forward confidently. Otherwise, we’ll address any findings before adding major new features. Let me know if you’d like to proceed with this validation phase or jump straight into additional enhancements.
