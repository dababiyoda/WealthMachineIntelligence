Here are **concise code-like excerpts** illustrating each of the three requested areas. They’re simplified for clarity—adjust as needed for your actual codebase and AI frameworks.

## 1. Hybrid Weighting & Feature Vector Construction

Below is a **pseudo-code** snippet from the `MarketIntelligenceAgent` showing how the 60/40 weighting between LSTM and traditional indicators is applied before passing data to the Random Forest classifier.

```python
class MarketIntelligenceAgent:

    def assess_risk(self, market_data):
        # 1) Get LSTM prediction (normalized or scaled)
        lstm_prediction = self.lstm_model.predict(market_data['time_series_window'])
        
        # 2) Aggregate traditional indicators (e.g., volatility, sentiment score, volume)
        traditional_score = self.compute_traditional_indicators(market_data['metrics'])
        
        # 3) Apply weighting
        # LSTM output has a 60% share, while traditional indicators have 40%.
        combined_score = (0.6 * lstm_prediction) + (0.4 * traditional_score)
        
        # Build a feature vector for the Random Forest
        feature_vector = {
            "lstm_component": lstm_prediction,
            "traditional_component": traditional_score,
            "combined_score": combined_score
        }
        
        # 4) Random Forest classification
        risk_class = self.random_forest_model.predict(feature_vector)
        
        # 5) Store or return results
        self.update_knowledge_graph(feature_vector, risk_class)
        return risk_class

    def compute_traditional_indicators(self, metrics):
        # Example of combining multiple indicators into one 'traditional_score'
        # Weighted or averaged—implement your own logic
        sentiment_part = metrics['sentiment_score'] * 0.5
        volatility_part = metrics['volatility'] * 0.3
        volume_part = metrics['volume'] * 0.2
        return sentiment_part + volatility_part + volume_part

    def update_knowledge_graph(self, feature_vector, risk_class):
        # Pseudocode for storing relevant data in the knowledge graph
        # Typically, you'd call a KG service or database API here
        kg_api.store_node_properties(
            node_id="market_assessment",
            properties={
                "lstm_value": feature_vector["lstm_component"],
                "traditional_value": feature_vector["traditional_component"],
                "combined_score": feature_vector["combined_score"],
                "risk_class": risk_class
            }
        )
