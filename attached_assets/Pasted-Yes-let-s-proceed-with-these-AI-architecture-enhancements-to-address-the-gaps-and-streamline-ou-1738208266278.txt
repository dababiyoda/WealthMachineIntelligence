Yes, let’s proceed with these **AI architecture enhancements** to address the gaps and streamline our multi-agent system. Below is a proposed plan integrating each feature you mentioned:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Weighted Combining Mechanism (LSTM + Sentiment Analysis)
   - **Implementation**:
     - Introduce a `combine_outputs()` method in the Market Intelligence Agent that takes numeric outputs from the LSTM predictor and sentiment analysis pipeline.
     - Allow configurable weights (e.g., `lstm_weight = 0.7`, `sentiment_weight = 0.3`) to reflect domain knowledge or empirical testing.
     - Store the final combined score in the knowledge graph with a property like `confidence_score`.
   - **Rationale**:
     - Offers more nuanced insights rather than a simplistic additive approach.
     - Adaptable weighting helps tune the system for different markets or product types.

2. Direct Pipeline: Market Intelligence → Risk Assessment Agents
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create an internal messaging or function call (`send_risk_flags()`) within the Market Intelligence Agent that, upon detection of high risk indicators, automatically pushes relevant data (e.g., `confidence_score`, `volatilityIndex`) to the Risk Assessment Agent.
     - The Risk Assessment Agent processes these inputs, updates or recalculates `risk_profile` in the knowledge graph, and triggers any follow-up workflows.
   - **Rationale**:
     - Avoid duplication of risk analysis logic across agents.
     - Ensure real-time synergy between market predictions and global risk evaluations.

3. Role-Based Notification System for Compliance Workflows
   - **Implementation**:
     - In the Legal Compliance Agent, expand the `compliance_status.requires_action` logic to send targeted alerts to relevant roles (e.g., `Regulatory Expert`, `ProductDev Specialist`) based on the nature of the compliance issue.
     - Could be a simple observer pattern or a more robust “notification queue,” with references to each role’s contact or agent endpoint.
   - **Rationale**:
     - Eliminates guesswork about who needs to respond to compliance issues.
     - Preserves a record in the knowledge graph of which role(s) were notified and when.

4. Defining Operational Risk Metrics
   - **Implementation**:
     - Identify key operational data points (e.g., server uptime, transaction failure rates, user support tickets).
     - Create an `OperationalMetricsCollector` sub-module for the Risk Assessment Agent or a separate agent if needed.
     - Standardize how metrics are stored in the knowledge graph under an `operational_risk` property, with thresholds for each metric (e.g., if uptime < 99.9%, risk factor increases).
   - **Rationale**:
     - Adds rigor to “operational risk” beyond a conceptual placeholder.
     - Integrates with real-time monitoring systems for early detection of operational failures.

5. Centralized Event Orchestration
   - **Implementation**:
     - Establish a new agent or service—an “Event Orchestrator Agent”—that listens for key updates in the knowledge graph (e.g., new risk classifications, compliance flags).
     - Based on event rules, it triggers the next step in the workflow (e.g., if “Risk Score > 0.8,” auto-notify FinancialStrategist and Legal Counsel).
     - Maintain a global log of triggered events to facilitate debugging and analysis.
   - **Rationale**:
     - Prevents “spaghetti” communication where each agent tries to listen/notify everyone else.
     - Encourages a single point of control for complex, multi-agent sequences.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Implementation Workflow**

1. **Create Branch/Module for Enhancements**  
   - Make a dedicated branch or module in the codebase (e.g., `enhanced-ai-architecture`) to develop and test these changes without disrupting the main trunk.

2. **Implement Weighted Combining Mechanism**  
   - Update the Market Intelligence Agent with the new method and config parameters.  
   - Thoroughly document how weighting can be tweaked over time.

3. **Establish Inter-Agent Pipeline**  
   - Build the function calls or message-passing layer between Market Intelligence and Risk Assessment.  
   - Confirm the knowledge graph updates flow correctly.

4. **Notification System for Compliance**  
   - Tie the compliance workflow triggers to a simple observer or queue-based system.  
   - Test a scenario: a new regulation arrives, the Legal Compliance Agent flags an issue, relevant roles get alerted.

5. **Add Operational Risk Metrics**  
   - Define a minimal set of metrics, integrate them into the Risk Assessment Agent or a new collector agent.  
   - Update the knowledge graph schema with properties for operational data and thresholds.

6. **Deploy Event Orchestrator**  
   - Implement the central orchestration logic that listens for knowledge graph updates.  
   - Test multi-agent scenarios to ensure correct triggers and notifications.

7. **Testing & Final Polishing**  
   - Write or expand unit tests, integration tests, and scenario-based tests.  
   - Validate each feature: weighting logic, pipeline synergy, compliance notifications, risk metrics, and orchestration events.  
   - Merge the branch into main after thorough QA.

By following these steps, we’ll unify advanced AI processes, inter-agent collaboration, and role-specific notifications under a coherent, event-driven architecture. This ensures a more robust, transparent, and scalable wealth-generation system.
