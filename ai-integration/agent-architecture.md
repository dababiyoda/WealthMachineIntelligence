## Ontology-Driven Operations

### SaaSVenture Integration
```yaml
# Example: Agent configuration based on venture type
venture:
  type: "SaaSVenture"
  required_agents:
    - market_intelligence:
        focus: ["service_trends", "pricing_models"]
    - legal_compliance:
        focus: ["data_protection", "service_agreements"]
    - operations:
        focus: ["service_uptime", "resource_scaling"]
```

# Example: Agent configuration for e-commerce
venture:
  type: "EcommerceVenture"
  required_agents:
    - market_intelligence:
        focus: ["product_trends", "competition"]
    - legal_compliance:
        focus: ["consumer_protection", "payment_regulations"]

   - Resolution: Priority-based decision tree
   - Ontology Impact: Updates RiskProfile with conflict resolution data

2. **Resource Allocation Conflicts**
   - Scenario: Multiple agents requesting same resources
   - Resolution: Resource allocation queue with priority levels
   - Ontology Impact: Modifies AIProcess resource claims

3. **Timeline Conflicts**

   - Resolution: Automated timeline adjustment with compliance priority
   - Ontology Impact: Updates project phases and deadlines

### Resolution Framework
```yaml
# Example: Conflict Resolution Configuration
conflict_resolution:
  priority_levels:
    compliance: 1  # Highest priority
    risk: 2
    market: 3
    operations: 4
