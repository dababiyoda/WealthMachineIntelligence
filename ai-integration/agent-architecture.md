# AI Agent Architecture

## Overview
Comprehensive framework for AI agent deployment and orchestration in digital business operations.
For detailed lifecycle and interaction specifications, see `/ai-integration/agent-lifecycle.md`.

## Agent Types

### Market Intelligence Agent

  - Updates RiskProfile based on findings
  - Interacts with MarketSegment data

### Legal Compliance Agent
- Regulatory monitoring
- Compliance verification
- Document analysis
- Risk flagging
- Communication Protocol: JSON events
- Trigger Conditions: compliance_breach, regulatory_update
- Ontology References:
  - Monitors all DigitalVenture subtypes
  - Updates RiskProfile compliance scores
  - Interfaces with AIProcess for automation level

### Customer Experience Agent
- Behavior analysis
- Satisfaction monitoring
- Service optimization
- Feedback processing
- Communication Protocol: JSON events
- Trigger Conditions: satisfaction_threshold, service_degradation
- Ontology References:
  - Analyzes ContentPlatform user data
  - Updates MarketSegment insights
  - Triggers AIProcess optimizations

### Operations Agent
- Process optimization
- Resource allocation
- Performance monitoring
- Quality assurance
- Communication Protocol: JSON events
- Trigger Conditions: resource_constraint, quality_threshold
- Ontology References:
  - Monitors all DigitalVenture operations
  - Updates efficiency metrics
  - Manages AIProcess resource allocation

## Communication Flows

### Market Intelligence → Risk Assessment
```plaintext
[Market Intelligence Agent] --market_volatility_event--> [Risk Assessment Agent]
  └── Trigger: Volatility exceeds threshold
  └── Payload: Market metrics, affected ventures
  └── Response: Updated risk scores
```

### Legal Compliance → Product Development
```plaintext
[Legal Compliance Agent] --regulation_update_event--> [Product Dev Agent]
  └── Trigger: New compliance requirement
  └── Payload: Regulation details, affected features
  └── Response: Updated roadmap
```

### Customer Experience → Operations
```plaintext
[Customer Experience Agent] --service_degradation_event--> [Operations Agent]
  └── Trigger: Performance threshold breach
  └── Payload: Service metrics, user impact
  └── Response: Resource allocation update
```

## Trigger Mechanisms

### Event-Driven Triggers
1. **Market Events**
   - Volatility threshold breaches
   - Competitor actions
   - Market sentiment shifts
   - Ontology Impact: Updates MarketSegment data

2. **Compliance Events**
   - Regulatory changes
   - Policy updates
   - License expirations
   - Ontology Impact: Updates RiskProfile

3. **Performance Events**
   - Resource constraints
   - Error rate spikes
   - Response time degradation
   - Ontology Impact: Modifies AIProcess parameters

### Schedule-Based Triggers
1. **Daily Operations**
   - Market analysis scans
   - Compliance checks
   - Performance metrics
   - Data synchronization

2. **Weekly Reviews**
   - Risk reassessment
   - Resource optimization
   - Trend analysis
   - Strategy updates

3. **Monthly Audits**
   - Comprehensive compliance
   - Performance reviews
   - Resource allocation
   - Strategy effectiveness
