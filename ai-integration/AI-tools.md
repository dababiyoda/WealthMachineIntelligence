## Multi-Agent Integration
For detailed understanding of how these tools integrate with the agent system:

1. **Tool Selection**
   - Review agent requirements in `/ai-integration/agent-architecture.md`
   - Match tools to agent capabilities
   - Configure according to security protocols

2. **Implementation**
   - Follow workflow patterns in `/ai-integration/agent-flow.md`
   - Implement error handling as per architecture
   - Set up monitoring and logging

3. **Deployment**
   - Use scalability guidelines in agent architecture
   - Follow security protocols for tool access
   - Monitor performance metrics

4. **Maintenance**
   - Regular updates per `/ai-integration/agent-lifecycle.md`
   - Performance optimization
   - Security audits
