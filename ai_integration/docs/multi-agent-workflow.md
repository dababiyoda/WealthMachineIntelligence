## Overview
Systematic process flow for AI agent collaboration in digital business operations.
For detailed agent lifecycle and interaction specifications, see `/ai_integration/docs/agent-lifecycle.md`.

## Workflow Stages

  - Risk assessment
  - Triggers: market_volatility, opportunity_threshold
- Data Processing Agent
  - Information validation
  - Pattern recognition
  - Report generation
  - Triggers: data_quality_threshold, pattern_confidence

### 2. Viability Assessment
- Financial Analysis Agent
  - Cost projection
  - Revenue modeling
  - Risk calculation
  - Triggers: financial_risk_threshold, profitability_assessment
- Market Validation Agent
  - Demand verification
  - Competition analysis
  - Market sizing
  - Triggers: market_size_threshold, competition_alert

### 3. MVP Development
- Development Optimization Agent
  - Resource allocation
  - Timeline planning
  - Quality assurance
  - Triggers: resource_constraint, timeline_deviation
- Testing Agent
  - Automated testing
  - Performance monitoring

- Knowledge graph integration
- Ontology-compliant data structures

## Inter-Agent Communication
- Event-driven architecture
- Priority-based message routing
- State synchronization
- Error handling protocols

## Ontology Integration
