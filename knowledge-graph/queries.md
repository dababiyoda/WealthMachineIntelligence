# Knowledge Graph Queries Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the structure and usage of knowledge graph queries within the WealthMachineOntology_DigitalAI framework. The queries are designed to extract meaningful insights from our ontological model of digital ventures, roles, and AI processes.

## Query Structure

### Basic Components
1. **Node Types**
   - Ventures (SaaSVenture, EcommerceVenture, ContentPlatform)
   - Roles (EmergingTechSpecialist, StrategicMarketTrendAnalyst, etc.)
   - Processes (AIProcess)
   - Profiles (RiskProfile, MarketSegment)

2. **Relationships**
   - contributesTo (Role → DigitalVenture)
   - automates (AIProcess → Role)
   - implementsAI (DigitalVenture → AIProcess)
   - targets (DigitalVenture → MarketSegment)

### Query Parameters
- `phase`: Current development phase of ventures
- `venture_type`: Type of digital venture (SaaS, Ecommerce, Content)
- `ai_module`: Boolean flag for AI integration
- `role_id`: Identifier for specific roles
- `process_type`: Type of AI process

## Query Types

### 1. Venture Queries
- Filter ventures by phase and AI capabilities
- Identify ventures with specific market segments
- Find ventures by risk profile

### 2. Role Analysis
- List roles contributing to a specific venture
- Find collaboration patterns between roles
- Identify roles with AI automation

### 3. AI Process Mapping
- Track AI implementation across ventures
- Analyze automation levels by venture type
- Map AI processes to business outcomes

## Usage Examples
See `query-examples.yaml` for practical implementations of these query patterns. The examples demonstrate how to:
1. List Phase2 ventures with AI modules
2. Find role collaborations on ventures
3. Analyze AI process distribution
4. Map market segments to venture types

## Best Practices
1. Always specify node types explicitly
2. Use relationship constraints for precise results
3. Include phase and AI module filters where relevant
4. Consider ontology constraints in queries
