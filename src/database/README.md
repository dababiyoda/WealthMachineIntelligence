# Database Overview

This module contains all database related code for WealthMachine Enterprise.
It provides a reusable connection manager (`connection.py`) and declarative
SQLAlchemy models (`models.py`). The schema tracks ventures, AI agents,
performance metrics and knowledge graph entities.

## Schema Relationships
- `DigitalVenture` is the central entity representing each business idea.
- `AIAgent` records individual AI agent instances linked to a venture.
- `PerformanceMetric`, `RiskAssessment`, and `MarketAnalysis` store
  analytics generated by agents.
- `KnowledgeGraphEntity` and `KnowledgeRelationship` form the internal
  knowledge graph used by the AI services.

Refer to `models.py` for full field definitions and enumerations.

## Migrations
The project relies on [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/) for
schema migrations. Initialize a migration environment with:

```bash
alembic init migrations
```

Create a revision whenever models change:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"
```

Apply migrations to the target database:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point to your PostgreSQL
instance before running migrations or starting the application.
