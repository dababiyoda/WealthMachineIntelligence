"""Adversarial underwriting cases: the committee argues with itself.

Every assessment carries competing cases — bull, bear, fraud/manipulation,
incumbent response, adoption friction, do-nothing, opportunity cost. The
critics are deterministic (testable, model-free) and may disagree;
disagreement is preserved, never averaged away. A severe unresolved
"against" case caps the verdict regardless of score: model or heuristic
confidence is not authority.

This module is mirrored in DALEOBANKS (services/adversarial_cases.py) so
the mock evaluator and the real engine present the same case structure.
Keep the two files field-for-field compatible.
