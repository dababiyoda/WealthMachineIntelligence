"""Transport parity with the kernel mirror, pinned.

`src/services/bridge_security.py` is one of three mirrors of the same module — the
others are `adapters/bridge_transport.py` in uniimente-kernel and
`src/services/bridge_security.py` in WealthMachineIntelligence. They are meant
to stay field-for-field compatible, which means a security fix landing in one is
a divergence until it lands in the others.

The kernel took two changes on 2026-08-22 under FOUNDER-RULING-2026-08-22. This
mirror took them on 2026-08-23. These tests are why they cannot silently come
back apart.
