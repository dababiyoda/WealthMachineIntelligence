## Knowledge Graph Integration

### Query Capabilities
The ontology supports sophisticated knowledge graph queries for real-time insights. Refer to the `/knowledge-graph` directory for:
- Comprehensive query documentation in `queries.md`
- Example query patterns in `query-examples.yaml`
- Database integration guidelines

### Key Query Types
1. **Basic Retrieval**: List ventures, roles, and processes
2. **Conditional Queries**: Filter by phase, AI capabilities
3. **Relationship Traversal**: Map connections between entities

### Usage Example
```yaml
# Find Phase3 ventures with ML models
match:
  venture:
    type: "DigitalVenture"
    properties:
      current_phase: "Phase3"
      requiresMLModel: true
```

For detailed documentation and examples, see the `/knowledge-graph` directory.
